# Data Mining Algorithms Repository

## Overview

This repository contains basic implementations of several data mining algorithms developed as part of our Data Mining class. Each algorithm is implemented with simplicity and clarity in mind, focusing on core concepts and techniques widely used in the field of data mining. The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on understanding of data mining methods, their applications, and performance considerations.

## Algorithms Implemented
- K-Means
- K-Medoids
- DBSCAN
- Apriori
- Association Rules

Each algorithm includes:
- A clear explanation of the technique.
- Implementation details.
- Sample datasets for testing.
